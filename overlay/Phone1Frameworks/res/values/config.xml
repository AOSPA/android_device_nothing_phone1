    <!-- Whether the display cutout region of the main built-in display should be forced to
     black in software (to avoid aliasing or emulate a cutout that is not physically existent).
     -->
     <bool name="config_fillMainBuiltInDisplayCutout">true</bool>

    <!-- The bounding path of the cutout region of the main built-in display.
         Must either be empty if there is no cutout region, or a string that is parsable by
         {@link android.util.PathParser}.
         The path is assumed to be specified in display coordinates with pixel units and in
         the display's native orientation, with the origin of the coordinate system at the
         center top of the display. Optionally, you can append either `@left` or `@right` to the
         end of the path string, in order to change the path origin to either the top left,
         or top right of the display.
         To facilitate writing device-independent emulation overlays, the marker `@dp` can be
         appended after the path string to interpret coordinates in dp instead of px units.
         Note that a physical cutout should be configured in pixels for the best results.
         Example for a 10px x 10px square top-center cutout:
                <string ...>M -5,0 L -5,10 L 5,10 L 5,0 Z</string>
         Example for a 10dp x 10dp square top-center cutout:
                <string ...>M -5,0 L -5,10 L 5,10 L 5,0 Z @dp</string>

    <!-- Like config_mainBuiltInDisplayCutout, but this path is used to report the
         one single bounding rect per device edge to the app via
         {@link DisplayCutout#getBoundingRect}. Note that this path should try to match the visual
         appearance of the cutout as much as possible, and may be smaller than
         config_mainBuiltInDisplayCutout
